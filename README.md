   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key-here"
   ```

4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

5. **Access the web interface**:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`

## üìä Usage

### Input Methods

1. **Upload Nmap XML**: Upload an Nmap scan result in XML format
2. **Paste Nmap Output**: Paste plain text Nmap results directly
3. **Use Sample Data**: Test with the included sample scan

### Analysis Settings

- **Include CVSS Scores**: Enable/disable CVSS score inclusion
- **Include Exploit Availability**: Show exploit availability information
- **Business Context**: Add organizational context for better risk assessment

### Output Sections

1. **AI-Enhanced Executive Summary**: Business-focused analysis with financial impact
2. **Technical Findings**: Detected services and versions
3. **Risk Scoring**: Dynamic risk scores with vulnerability details
4. **AI Exploit Predictions**: Likelihood assessment and attack vectors
5. **AI-Generated Fix Recommendations**: Detailed remediation with configuration changes
6. **Traditional Patch Recommendations**: Specific update commands and vendor advisories
7. **Business Impact Summary**: Executive-friendly risk analysis
8. **Action Plan**: Prioritized remediation steps

## üîç Example Analysis

### Sample Input
```
PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp   open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.2p2 Ubuntu 4ubuntu2.8
80/tcp   open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.18 ((Ubuntu))
```

### Sample Output

**Risk Assessment**:
- OpenSSH 7.2p2: Risk Score 8/10 (High)
- Apache 2.4.18: Risk Score 9/10 (Critical)

**AI Exploit Predictions**:
- OpenSSH: 70% exploit likelihood, 1-2 weeks to exploit
- Apache: 80% exploit likelihood, 24-48 hours to exploit

**AI-Generated Fix Recommendations**:
- **Immediate Actions**: Disable root login, enable key-based auth, update versions
- **Configuration Changes**: Set MaxAuthTries, configure session management
- **Security Measures**: Implement fail2ban, WAF, rate limiting
- **Monitoring**: Track failed logins, monitor access patterns

**Key Vulnerabilities**:
- CVE-2016-10009: Privilege escalation (CVSS 7.5)
- CVE-2017-3167: Remote code execution (CVSS 9.8)

**Patch Recommendations**:
- Update OpenSSH to 8.9p1 or later
- Update Apache to 2.4.57 or later
- Implement security headers and WAF
